# Sales Analysis Project  

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Sales Data Analysis workflow**, starting from raw data preprocessing to generating insights and an interactive dashboard.  

The project is divided into three major stages:  

1. **Data Processing with Excel**  
2. **Exploratory Analysis with Jupyter Notebook (Python)**  
3. **Interactive Dashboard with Power BI**

## 📊 Workflow  

### 1. Data Processing (Excel)  
- Cleaned raw sales data  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Created pivot tables for initial exploration  
- Performed aggregations (Revenue, Units Sold, Discounts, etc.)

---

### 2. Exploratory & Predictive Analysis (Python Notebook)  
- Imported processed Excel data into Python  
- Preprocessed data: encoding, handling outliers, scaling  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Built predictive models (Regression) to estimate **Revenue** based on factors like Units Sold, Discount%, Category, and Brand  
- Evaluated models using **RMSE** and **R²** metrics

### 3. Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI)  
- Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for business insights  
- Visuals include:  
  - Revenue by Store  
  - Revenue by Category & Brand  
  - Impact of Discounts on Sales  
  - Monthly Trends & KPIs

## 📌 Key Insights  
- Discounts have a measurable impact on sales revenue.  
- Certain categories and brands drive the majority of sales.  
- Store-level analysis highlights top-performing and underperforming outlets.  
- Predictive modeling helps estimate revenue with reasonable accuracy.
